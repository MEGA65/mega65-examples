# Plasma example in LLVM C++ (`clang`)

This illustrates how to set up a C++ project using `clang++` from the
[llvm-mos project](https://llvm-mos.org/wiki/Welcome)
and the official [`mega65-libc`](https://github.com/MEGA65/mega65-libc).
The latter is automatically downloaded by the `CMake` build system.

Clang provides modern compiler features and as illustrated in `plasma.c`,
using `#pragma unroll`, significant speedups can be achieved in targeted
bottle-necks.
It is also interesting to enable pedantic compiler warnings which aids in catching
bugs early on.
The setup can be easily adapted to instead use C (`clang`); you merely need to
update `CMakeLists.txt` with `C` instead of `CXX` in the language setting.

## Building and Running

1. Download the [llvm-mos-sdk](https://github.com/llvm-mos/llvm-mos-sdk/releases) binary
   and unpack to _e.g._ `$HOME/llvm-mos`.
2. Configure and build with:
   ~~~ bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/llvm-mos . 
   make
   ~~~

Run in Xemu using `make run` or transfer and run on hardware using `make hw`.
The latter requires [`matrix65`](https://files.mega65.org?id=c6ac58ca-66cd-4cd0-9746-6b0c7a575371);
please edit `CMakeLists.txt` to adjust the serial device name,
or change to instead use the `m65.exe` transfer tool.
